# Periodic-Table
This is Modern Periodic Table Project. The language I used  for designing the periodic table are HTML and CSS.<br>
• The periodic table can be clearly seen with s, p, d, f block differentiation. I have used different colours for different block.<br>
• I have used hover effect in each element so that it looks more beautiful.<br>
• When click on any Element then it’s Wikipedia will open. <br>

# Periodic-Table
This is Modern Periodic Table Project. The language I used for designing the periodic table are HTML and CSS. I thought I also used some Java script concept but I was unable to do this but when I fix that problem I will add those concept.<br>

# Features
*  The periodic table can be clearly seen with s, p, d, f block differentiation. I have used different colours for different block.<br>
* I have used hover effect in each element so that it looks more beautiful.<br>
* When click on any Element then the Wikipedia of that element will be open. <br>
